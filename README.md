# Jan's Static Setup

This is a simple setup for building websites that emit static assets, i.e., a
SPA using React, built with Webpack.

For setup, perform the following steps:

1. Get the files of this repo, preferably without the `.git` folder:
  `git archive --format=tar --remote=<repository URL> HEAD | tar xf -`
2. Perform installation: `./install.js`
